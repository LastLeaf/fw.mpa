## Guide - I18n Support ##

If you want i18n support, add `app.locale` in configuration. An example:

```js
// /fwconfig.js
module.exports = {
	app: {
		locale: ['en', 'zh-CN']
	}
}
```

Then for the templates you want to translate, say `index.tmpl`, create a dir `index.locale` and put translation files in it. Each file is a JSON object:

```json
{
	"original text": "translated text"
}
```

In `index.tmpl`, mark original texts out using "\`", like "\`original text\`". If you want "\`" it self, use "\`\`", and never put "\`" inside original texts (translate them out!).

Currently, a special run mode `FW=LOCALE` will extract all strings needed to be translated in, and generate the json object automatically.

If the original text is not appeared in templates, you can put them in an additional object in locale files. They will be sent to browser side and can be translated using `page.tmpl.i18n(...)`. An example:

```json
[{
	"original text": "translated text"
},{
	"additional text": "additional translation"
},{
	"unused text": "you can put temp translations here, ignored by framework"
}]
```

Translations in the first object cannot be visited by scripts. However, they are efficient because they are just cached in the translated templates when server starts.
